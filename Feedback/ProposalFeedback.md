I have given some minor comments for the leading question, data, and algorithms.

**Leading question:**

What does the shortest path (Dijkstra's algorithm) actually tell you? What is the meaning/use of the shortest path and the shortest distance between 2 Congress members?

**Dataset:** 

How will you check for wrong datatype or invalid entry in the datatset?

**Algorithms:** 

This is just a warning; the time complexity of Dijkstra's is O((V+E) log(V)) only when using a heap, please keep this in mind when coding it.
