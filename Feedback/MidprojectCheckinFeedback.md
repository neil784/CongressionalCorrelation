# Comments

You have made progress so far and have finished the data extraction and pre-processing. You have shown me that the data has been pre-processed and made into a graph, but you have not provided formal test cases to verify the same. So, I cannot fully verify if the graph has been created correctly.

Also, you have not started working on the algorithms yet, so I would recommend spending more time on the project in the coming weeks to finish it on time.
